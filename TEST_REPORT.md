## Summary

_Briefly describe how you tested your module, and why you chose that approach — clearly enough
that someone else could carry out the same tests._

## Test Results

| What was tested                                                        | How it was tested                                                                                                                 | Result                                                                    |

| `Jpeg.load(path)` returns a `Picture` instance for a valid image file. | Automated unit test (Vitest): loaded `test-image.jpg` and checked that the return value had `getHeight()`/`getWidth()` methods.   | ✅ Passed.                                                                |
| `Picture.getPixelAt(x, y)` with coordinates outside the image.         | Manual test via the Test-App's interface: entered a coordinate pair larger than the image's width/height and observed the output. | ❌ Didn't throw an error initially — fixed, now throws a clear exception. |
